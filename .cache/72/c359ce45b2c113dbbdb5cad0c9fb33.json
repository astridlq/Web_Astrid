We can state some websites like Designspiration, Awwwards, Freshome, but also social media like Dribbble, Pinterest or Instagram. All of this is quite overwhelming and it can become difficult to save pieces of inspiration and trace them back in an efficient way.\n          <br>\n          <br>\n          <span class=\"name-color\">Let’s create a new tool that would allow interior designers to do so...</span></p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"container-ironhack\">\n      <div class=\"persona\">\n        <h2>Persona</h2>\n\n        <div class=\"persona-intro\">\n          <div>\n            <p>Caroline, 31 years old.

Opened a small Interior Design agency 4 years ago in Paris for a wealthy clientele (3 employees).\n              <br><br>\n              Goal: <br>Attaches a high importance to give a unique identity to each project, construction / renovation.

Has an Instagram account for her agency with many followers. Posts in her feed and stories the work in progress of the different projects. Has a website for any inquiries and a Facebook page on which she is less active. She opened an internship position to manage the social media of the agency.\n          <br><br>\n          Frustration:\n          <br>\n          Has to deal with several projects at the same time: finds it difficult to take time to look for inspiration on social media. Her favorite one is Pinterest but it is sometimes not relevant for what she is looking for. <br>\n          Usually finds inspiration in shops or when traveling. Takes pictures of places she visits with her iPhone, adds it to its favorites or creates albums by category. Even if she remembers well where she saw something interesting, finds it difficult to filter all this accumulated content when she needs to trace it back: spends a lot of time scrolling in her photo library as it is mixed with her personal images / doesn’t think to use the map functionality as she sometimes forgets to active the geolocation. In addition, not easy to share it with the rest of the team.\n          <br><br>\n          Favorite brands: <br>Sezane, Bash, Sandro (clothes), Madura, RocheBobois (Design)\n          <br><br>\n          Hobbies: <br>Cooking, traveling, swimming.</p>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"scope-design\">\n\n          <h2>Scope & design process.</h2>\n\n\n          <p>Problem to overcome: <br>\n            The lack of time to organize, trace back and share inspirational photos of objects / places visited. <br><br>\n            Creative tool: <br>\n            To solve this problem, I put myself in Caroline’s shoes and listed the different things that would make it easier for her to find and save pieces of inspiration. I created a mind map to get a big picture of the different issues:\n          </p>\n\n          <div class=\"mindmap-scope\">\n            <img src=\"/674d29ec3475a894dcf8eeba10bee4f8.png\" class=\"image-project-detail\" alt=\"mindmap\" height=\"300\">\n\n            <p>This led me to think of something based on a map. It is quite easy to remember where we have seen something: during a travel in one country, an exhibition, in a shop… The map idea includes the travelling dimension as well: interior design varies a lot from countries to countries due to different cultural influences. <br>I also wanted to keep the idea of the mood-board as this is something that designers use a lot for their work (I noticed this during my internship in a Digital Agency working with graphic designers).</p>\n          </div>\n          <p>\n            I thus came up with the idea of an application which allows the users to pin photos on a map and create tags in order to filter the content.\n            <br><br>\n            Not to forget the problem of sharing easily with colleagues, I wanted to add a social dimension to that app: making it possible to add friends in order to see their maps and filter by their tags.\n            <br><br>\n            I  imagined 2 different possible views:\n            <ol>\n              <li>Map view: </li>\n              The user sees the pins of its pictures on a map. Pins appear as a little thumbnail of the photo to differentiate them. It is possible to take a photo directly or choose from the photo library. Then the users can add tags and comments. If the user clicks on a pin, the photo appears with the tags and the comments.\n              This view is a convenient and fast way to trace back the images by location as this is something that users usually remember. No need to scroll down on the content to find the correct image.\n              <br><br>\n              <li>List view:</li>\n              Photos appears next to each other, in a similar way as on Pinterest. Possible to filter the content by date, location or tags. This view allows the user to have the overview of all the images associated to one/several tag(s). It is a nice and fast way to create interchangeable mood-boards.\n            </ol>\n          </p>\n\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"wireframing\">\n          <h2>Wireframing.</h2>\n\n          <p>\n            <ul class=\"image-project-list-3\">\n              <li><img src=\"/9a5d122dbdbe60bb9227913c6cb2378c.png\" class=\"image-project-detail-3\" alt=\"wireframe\"></li>\n              <li><img src=\"/46aeab58c7239efccbb33a782a5da2e6.png\" class=\"image-project-detail-3\" alt=\"wireframe\"></li>\n              <li><img src=\"/b30dbfddf16245f05f309813553d9dac.png\" class=\"image-project-detail-3\" alt=\"wireframe\"></li>\n            </ul>\n          </p>\n          <h2>Learnings</h2>\n          <p>Thanks to this challenge, I realized that it is very important to have a strong User research in order to create the best solution possible to answer the user need. Due to the limited time, I decided to skip the data search that would backup my assumptions as it was pretty tough to obtain some information. I put myself in a personas’ shoes trying to be as specific as possible to pinpoint Caroline’s frustrations: what issue would she cope with in her daily job to look for inspiration pieces she’s seen? This and the mind map helped me see clearly which problems the tool had to solve.\n            <br> <br>\n            Besides, I understood the importance to do lo-fi wireframes on paper first (& with a pencil and a ruler to keep it clean! Apology for mines which don’t look so great…). It shows directly what works or not to fill the screen, with the important content being displayed above the fold. I also had a lot of fun making the interactive prototype even though it was challenging to do it that quickly as I am a bit perfectionist (3h for the whole project - some navigation links are missing). But I understand it is important not to be too perfectionist at the beginning of the project as the end result is always different than the first mockups. New ideas to get better intuitive UI always comes up while actually designing the tool, but also certainly while testing it with a small group of users.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n        <a href=\"https://marvelapp.com/6hhh3hf/screen/55423206\" target=\"new\" class=\"button\">See the project</a>\n        <a href=\"/\" target=\"blank\" class=\"button\">Back to Portfolio</a>\n\n\n\n      </div>\n      <!-- Footer -->\n      <div class=\"footer\">\n  <div class=\"footer-copyright\">\n    © 2019 Astrid Le Quéré\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"footer-links\">\n    <a href=\"https://github.com/astridlq\" target=\"blank\"><i class=\"fab fa-github\"></i></a>\n    <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/astridlqr/\" target=\"blank\"><i class=\"fab fa-instagram\"></i></a>\n    <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/astridlequere/\" target=\"blank\"><i class=\"fab fa-linkedin\"></i></a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n\n      <script src=\"/0364f57fbff2fabbe941ed20c328ef1a.js\"></script>\n    </body>\n    </html>\n\n"},"sourceMaps":null,"error":null,"hash":"407b730545f6e489b81261eee3fb7f67","cacheData":{}}
