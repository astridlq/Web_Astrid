    <div class="problem">
      <h2>PROBLEM</h2>

      <p>Number ONE in France of the infant milk's brands, Laboratoire Gallia needed to reinvent itself to keep its strategic leadership position within the market. Originally, Laboratoire Gallia was targeting parents who needed to find expertise in the product they were buying for their babies. The name "Laboratoire" itself was the expression of this scientific positioning. <br><br>After some focus groups, the Marketing department decided to change the positioning of the brand to find a better market-fit and to answer to a wider range of potential customers. They decided to transfrom the brand identity to a more cocooning one by focusing on the bond that exists between the kids and their parents. <br><br>

        An important fact that needed to be taken into account for this project is the WHO regulation over infant milk. It is forbidden for brands to promote any infant milk product before the 6th months of the baby in developed countries - and this goes up to 1 year for some developping countries. <br>That regulation has a huge impact on the market startegy. In our case, how to make sure that parents would buy Laboratoire Gallia products after the mom decides to stop breathfeeding (45% of the moms stop after 3 months in France) even though it is not possible to even promote the product anywhere?

    <div class="solution">
      <h2>SOLUTION</h2>
      <p>
        In order to change for a more cocooning identity, we put a big effort into creating services for the mom during the pregnancy (eg. the nutrition guide 1 Assiette pour 2) and during the first months of the baby. In that way we would make sure that she remembers the name Laboratoire Gallia while at the supermarket or at the pharmacy when she has to decide which first infant milk bottle to buy. In case it suits the baby, she would become a loyal customer to the brand for 3 years in 75% of the cases.

        <h2>MY ROLE</h2>
        <p>I worked as Assistant Project manager for this project. I was in charge to validate with the Design Agency the user flow, mockups and the final prototype of the interface. We had several workshops to identify the target audience, to discuss about the new identity of the brand and to reflect on what the designers were suggesting for the project.</p>
