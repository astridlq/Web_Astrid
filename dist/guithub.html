    <div class="problem">
      <h2>PROBLEM</h2>
      <p>Have you ever thought to try playing an instrument but you decided not to because it was too expensive to rent one for a store? Or are you a musician travelling the world but you cannot bring your piano everywhere with you and you terribly miss playing? (For sure it might be tricky to board with a 150-250kg checked-in piano...!). Well, many music lovers are coping with these kind of problems. In the meantime, there might be someone nearby - with a guitar taking the dust in a room - that'd be more than willing to make those music lovers happy by lending their instrument for a while.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="solution">
      <h2>SOLUTION</h2>
      <p>
        Guit-Hub: the name speaks for itself... A hub for guitars (but not only!) <br>
        On this platform, people can list their instruments and rent it to other musicians for a certain amount and during an agreed time. It is kind of an AirBnb but for instruments! We decided to make the search very easy - per location, name or category - and to have a dashboard that would gather all the information (bookings, rentings) in one page only. Let's play more music with GuitHub!

      <div class="my-role">
        <h2>MY ROLE</h2>
        <p>This project was part of the coding bootcamp I followed in Amsterdam - @ Le Wagon. With 3 other teammates, we had to come up with a marketplace idea. The 1st day was dedicated to the UX research, the user flow and mockups - which was very short and challenging in terms of timing. We then had to make it happen and we coded for the rest of the week.
        <br>I was in charge of the front-end together with another teammate. I focused on most of the pages except for the dashboard.</p>
