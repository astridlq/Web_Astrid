    <div class="problem">
      <h2>PROBLEM</h2>

      <p>One thing every creative professional has in common is that they are always observing the world seeking for inspiration. There are many ways to organize information and there are various types of input that can trigger innovation and creative thinking.
        <br>For this case study, I created a tool for designers and creative people, so that they can safely save pieces of inspiration and trace them back in an efficient way when they need to.
        <br><br>
        I focused on Interior Designers: they are in constant search of new creative ideas and objects for their projects…
        Many tools exist on the internet that can help them to find the inspiration they are looking for. We can state some websites like Designspiration, Awwwards, Freshome, but also social media like Dribbble, Pinterest or Instagram. All of this can become quite overwhelming.  The lack of time to organize, to trace back and to share inspirational photos of objects and places they visited is one of main issue Interior designers can cope with.

    <div class="solution">
      <h2>SOLUTION</h2>
      <p>
        To solve this problem, I decided to design a mobile application which allows users to pin photos on a map and create tags in order to filter the content. <br>Methodology:
        <ul>
          <li>Persona</li>
          <li>Mind map</li>
          <li>Early drawings</li>
          <li>Wireframes and Prototype (Marvel)</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <!-- mind map -->

      <h2>MIND MAP</h2>
      <div class="mindmap-scope">
        <p>To solve the problem, I put myself in Caroline’s shoes and listed the different things that would make it easier for her to find and save pieces of inspiration resulting in this mind map. <br><br>This led me to think of something based on a map. <br>It is pretty easy to remember where we have seen something: during a trip, at  an exhibition, in a shop… <br>The map idea includes the travelling dimension as well: interior design varies a lot from countries to countries due to different cultural influences. <br>I also wanted to keep the idea of the mood-board as this is something that designers use a lot for their work (I noticed this during my internship in a Digital Agency working with graphic designers).</p>

        <!-- idea -->

        <h2>IDEA</h2>

        <p>I thus came up with the idea of an application which allows the users to pin photos on a map and create tags in order to filter the content.
          <br>I also wanted to add a social dimension to that app to solve the problem of sharing easily with colleagues. I decided to make it possible to add friends in order to see their maps and filter by their tags.
          <br><br>I imagined 2 different possible views:</p>
          <div class="app-view">
            <div class="row">
              <div class="column">
                <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dduozp62x/image/upload/c_scale,h_500/v1565429533/portfolio/mapview_pha77n.png">
                <p>- Map view - <br><br>The user sees the pins of its pictures on a map. Pins appear as a little thumbnail of the photo to differentiate them. It is possible to take a photo directly or choose from the photo library. Then the users can add tags and comments. If the user clicks on a pin, the photo appears with the tags and the comments.
                This view is a convenient and fast way to trace back the images by location as this is something that users usually remember. No need to scroll down on the content to find the correct image.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="column">
                <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dduozp62x/image/upload/c_scale,h_500/v1565429536/portfolio/listview_flpcdz.png">
                <p>- List view -<br><br>Photos appears next to each other, in a similar way as on Pinterest. Possible to filter the content by date, location or tags. This view allows the user to have the overview of all the images associated to one/several tag(s). It is a nice and fast way to create interchangeable mood-boards.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>Ok, I need to draw the wireframes again - first draft was not very readable I have to say... <br>But you can have a look at the prototype <a href="https://marvelapp.com/2377c83g" target="blank" class="link-prototype">HERE!</a></p>
