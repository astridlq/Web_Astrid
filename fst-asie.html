        <p>Showing solutions, telling a feel-good story… this may be the best way to solve the ecological crises that our countries are going through.
          <br>
          The aim of the Food Sense Tour is to document the activities of entrepreneurs chosen upstream for their contribution to the sustainable food product cycle: production, distribution, consumption and recycling. Those concrete and positive actions in the agriculture field are a first step to figure out what could be tomorrow's world…

        <h2>Graphic Design</h2>
        <p>This final project was part of a Graphic Design course I follow during my Master's degree at Hong-Kong University of Science and Technology (2017).
          The aim was to promote one project of our choice and to create graphic components thanks to Photoshop, Illustrator...
          <br><br>
          I used the WIX platform to showcase a website of my project. The idea was to have a landing page explaining the whole concept of a Food Sense Tour, the itinerary I would do across Asia and a short intro of myself.
          <br>Users could then find out more information on different sections: About, Project, Portraits, Sponsors.
          <br><br>
          I used green colors for the main theme as it relates to the environment, trees and plants.
          <br>For the logo, I decided to design it in a round shape to give the idea of a “tour”. I also wanted to create a font for the capital letter “A” that would remind the user of chopsticks and rice – Asia it is!
