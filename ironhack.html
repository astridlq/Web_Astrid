    <div class="problem">
      <h2>PROBLEM</h2>

      <p>One thing every creative professional has in common is that they are always observing the world seeking for inspiration. There are many ways to organize information and there are various types of input that can trigger innovation and creative thinking.
        <br>For this case study, which was part of an assignment for IronHack bootcamp, I created a tool for designers and creative people, so that they can safely save pieces of inspiration and trace them back in an efficient way when they need to.
        <br><br>
        I focused on Interior Designers: they are in constant search of new creative ideas and objects for their projects…
        Many tools exist on the internet that can help them to find the inspiration they are looking for. We can state some websites like Designspiration, Awwwards, Freshome, but also social media like Dribbble, Pinterest or Instagram. All of this can become quite overwhelming.  The lack of time to organize, to trace back and to share inspirational photos of objects and places they visited is one of main issue Interior designers can cope with.

    <div class="solution">
      <h2>SOLUTION</h2>
      <p>
        To solve this problem, I decided to design a mobile application which allows users to pin photos on a map and create tags in order to filter the content. <br>Methodology:
        <ul>
          <li>Persona</li>
          <li>Mind map</li>
          <li>Ideation</li>
          <li>Prototype (Marvel)</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h2>MIND MAP</h2>
      <div class="mindmap-scope">
        <p>To solve the problem, I put myself in Caroline’s shoes and listed the different things that would make it easier for her to find and save pieces of inspiration resulting in this mind map. <br><br>This led me to think of something based on a map. <br>It is pretty easy to remember where we have seen something: during a trip, at  an exhibition, in a shop… <br>The map idea includes the travelling dimension as well: interior design varies a lot from countries to countries due to different cultural influences. <br>I also wanted to keep the idea of the mood-board as this is something that designers use a lot for their work (I noticed this during my internship in a Digital Agency working with graphic designers).</p>

        <!-- idea -->

        <h2>IDEATION</h2>

        <p>I thus came up with the idea of an application which allows the users to pin photos on a map and create tags in order to filter the content.
          <br>I also wanted to add a social dimension to that app to solve the problem of sharing easily with colleagues. I decided to make it possible to add friends in order to see their maps and filter by their tags.
          <br><br>I imagined 2 different possible views:</p>
          <div class="app-view">
            <div class="row">
              <div class="column">
                <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dduozp62x/image/upload/c_scale,h_500/v1565429533/portfolio/mapview_pha77n.png">
                <p>- Map view - <br><br>The user sees the pins of its pictures on a map. Pins appear as a little thumbnail of the photo to differentiate them. It is possible to take a photo directly or choose from the photo library. Then the users can add tags and comments. If the user clicks on a pin, the photo appears with the tags and the comments.
                This view is a convenient and fast way to trace back the images by location as this is something that users usually remember. No need to scroll down on the content to find the correct image.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="column">
                <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dduozp62x/image/upload/c_scale,h_500/v1565429536/portfolio/listview_flpcdz.png">
                <p>- List view -<br><br>Photos appears next to each other, in a similar way as on Pinterest. Possible to filter the content by date, location or tags. This view allows the user to have the overview of all the images associated to one/several tag(s). It is a nice and fast way to create interchangeable mood-boards.</p>
              </div>
            </div>

        <h2>PROTOTYPE</h2>

          <p>Due to the time constraint from the assignement (5h), I didn't spend a lot of time on wireframing and started almost right away with a high-fi prototype.</p>

          <h2>LEARNINGS</h2>
          <p>5h is very short to do a UX design assignment. I had some difficulties to spend enough time on each step of the design process.<br>If we speak in terms of Design Thinking:
            <ul>
              <li><b>Emphasize</b>: I've spent about 30 minutes to do some research on tools that enable to store creative ideas, like Pinterest for instance. I asked to some friends which took they used and why: most of them like to use their phone as it is mobile and they can access it on the go.</li>
              <li><b>Define</b>: I wanted to cover something that hasn't really been tackled yet: interior design, and combine it with the idea of travel. I used a persona to help me define the problem.</li>
              <li><b>Ideate</b>: A mind map helped me to go step by step in the direction I took with the map / list idea.</li>
              <li><b>Prototype</b>: Even if I wanted to gain some time on wireframing to finish the assignment on time , I realised that I actually spent way more than I thought I would (about 3h30). The reason for that is that I had to adjust some parts of the high-fi prototype which was way more time-consumming than if I had to do so on a low-fi one. I've learnt that I should always spend enough time on sketching different design ideas to avoid coping with this issue.</li>
              <li><b>Test</b>: I only tested my design with a friend to make sure the navigation and the purpose of the app was clear. I am happy it was!</li>
            </ul>
