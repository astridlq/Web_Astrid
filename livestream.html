    <div class="problem">
      <h2>PROBLEM</h2>

      <p>As most of the events around the world are being cancelled, it is time for artists and event organisers to be creative to save the music industry. A lot of live streaming events are popping up on the internet. This is very nice, but it can also become quite overwhelming. Only few platforms actually list all the livestreams happening on the globe. People can miss online events from their favorite artists if they are not constantly on the lookout.
        <br><br>TicketSwap is a secondary ticketing platform to discover live events and to buy and resell tickets in a safe and secure way. The impact of COVID-19 on live music events and theatres makes it impossible for the company to enable the sale of any tickets.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="solution">
      <h2>SOLUTION</h2>
      <p>
        To cope with the situation and as a quick fix, TicketSwap created a <a href="https://www.ticketswap.uk/blog/upcoming-live-stream-parties-and-gigs" target="blank" class="link-prototype">blogpost</a> with the list of top and mostly recurring livestream events. The blogpost has ~40 click through rate which is quite high and shows that fans are interested in this content.<br>Thus, this situation becomes an opportunity for TicketSwap to focus on the event discovery part of the platform. Be Fan Fanatical is one of TicketSwap core value: listing and showcasing all the livestreams in one single place on the internet makes life of fans easier.
        <br><br><u>Long-term vision</u>:
        <ul>
          <li>Enabling fans to browse livestream events will be beneficial for brand awareness: be on top of users mind for when the industry recovers.</li>
          <li>This also educate users that TicketSwap is not only a marketplace – for which most of them are using it – but also a discovery platform.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

          <p>Platforms that picked-up the idea of livestream browsing were only a few at the beginning of the crisis: BandsInTown, Resident Advisor are the 2 main ones alongside the event feature on Facebook.
            <ul>
              <li>BandsInTown and Resident Advisor list the events that are going to happen but there is no possibility to watch the livestream directly on the website.</li>
              <li>Facebook doesn’t allow an easy search with the category tag “livestream” for the events.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

      </div>
      <p>In the case of this project, we decided to focus on 2 features: browsing and broadcasting online events. This will help to connect TicketSwap even more with the fans. The aim is to enable users to:
        <ul>
          <li>Search for specific online events quickly.</li>
          <li>Suggest online events that match their tastes.</li>
          <li>Watch the livestream directly on the platform.</li>
        </ul>
