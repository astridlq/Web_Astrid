    <div class="project-title"><h1>Nike Digital Showroom Experience</h1></div>

    <!-- CONTEXT -->

    <div class="intro">
      <h2>INTRO</h2>

      <p>Nike wanted to create a premium digital experience for the B2B ordering process. If it was very expensive to produce many samples, there were a lot of frictions during sales meetings. My team came up with a Digital Showroom Experience as a solution to cope with these issues. <br>After a long phase of research, we deep dived into ideation and prototypes to finally create a virtual showroom experience with digital samples. After some tests during sales meetings, we improved it and created new tailored digital showrooms for 5 other big customers. <br>This was a success. <br><br>Let me explain you the whole story... </p>

    <div class="context">
      <h2>CONTEXT</h2>

      <p>I’ve worked at Nike as Digital Go to Market (DGTM) Experience Specialist. <br>
        In this DGTM team, we aimed to improve the user experience for our B2B clients (Intersport, Footlocker, SDI…) through the 4 phases of the order process.<br><br>
        We supported Account Executives (AE) to:
        <ul>
          <li><b>Prepare</b>: get the different offerings ready for their clients</li>
          <li><b>Present</b>: sell the offerings with story marketing content</li>
          <li><b>Collaborate</b>: fine tune orders together with the clients</li>
          <li><b>Finalize</b>: place orders through the Nike B2B online shop.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

  <div class="container-project">
    <p>I had the opportunity to work on several project for different phases of the process. For instance:
      <ul>
        <li><b>Present</b>: Virtual Reality experience for the Football category</li>
        <li><b>Finalize</b>: Digital collection book for Intersport</li>
      </ul><br>
      <p>After 1 year being on the field, dealing with AEs, showrooms and client meetings, I acquired a 360 understanding of this digital B2B experience. <br>That’s how I moved into another position to manage and develop the Virtual Showroom Experience for several accounts.</p>

        <h2>BACKGROUND RESEARCH</h2>
        <br>
        <h4>Ordering process & showroom setup.</h4>
        <div class="img-left">
          <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dduozp62x/image/upload/c_scale,q_auto/v1603887618/portfolio/Screenshot_2020-10-28_at_13.19.51_w3ehl1.png" width="30%" class="image-project-detail mindmap-image" alt="mindmap">
          <div>
            <p>Nike EMEA orders a huge number of samples for each new collection to distribute it among 10 showrooms during the sell-in period (which occurs 4 times a year).<br>
              I assisted many times the AEs in the placement of their order. I also took care of setting up the showrooms with the correct samples, which took on average 3-4 days with 5 people working full-time.<br>
              I noticed that AEs were often very busy to prepare for their sales meetings and they had not a lot of time to help to setup the showrooms. This was a real pain point for them, even though it was crucial they helped since they were the ones with the knowledge of the products.<br>
            Besides many duplicates, 30% of the samples were not even in their final version: some were missing, other ones were not in the correct colour/material.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h4>Client meetings.</h4>
        <p>I attended different types of client meetings (from big accounts like Intersport, to small ones). Clients often followed PowerPoint presentations on a small TV from a distance taking notes on a printed version that was given to them at the beginning of the day. I realised that missing samples or wrong ones were a real struggle for AEs to lead their meeting efficiently.

      <!-- PROBLEM -->

      <div class="problem">
        <h2>PROBLEM</h2>
        <p>We gathered as a team to highlight the different problems after sharing our observations. We came up with some "How might we" questions to help us frame the main issue:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>How might we reduce samples waste (production, shipment, storage, wrong samples)?</li>
          <li>How might we change the showroom setup process to enable AEs to focus on the preparation of their meetings?</li>
          <li>How might we make sure AEs have the correct samples to present during their sales meeting with clients?</li>
          <li>How might we improve the B2B overall showroom experience to make it more interactive and efficient?</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p class="problematic"><i>GOAL: To create a premium digital selling experience <br>in order to land the account offering.</i></p>
      <h2>JOB-TO-BE-DONE</h2>
      <p class="job-to-be-done"><b>As</b> an Account Executive, <b>when</b> preparing for a sales meeting, <b>I want to</b> be sure I have the correct materials to work, <b>so I can</b> efficiently lead interactive sessions with my clients.</p>

      <!-- IDEATION -->

      <div class="ideation">
        <h2>IDEATION</h2>
        <p>We investigated on several solutions to answer this need. To do that, we used different technologies such as holograms, 3D modelling, or iBeacon…</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="container-project">
      <div class="ideation">
      <p>The one that we deciced to move forward with was the <b>Virtual Showroom Experience</b>.
        <br>Some of the reasons were:
        <ul>
          <li><b>Technology</b>: the easiest solution to implement within all the showrooms across Europe.</li>
          <li><b>Costs</b>: the most cost-effective solution we’ve found for the long term regarding investments and savings on the sample orders (numbers are confidentials).</li>
          <li><b>Time</b>: a very flexible solution that can be adjusted at the last minute by the AE.</li>
        </ul>
      </p><br>
      <p>We wanted to create a virtual showroom which would showcase 3D models of the samples presented during the sell-in sessions. <br>Initially, PowerPoint presentations were displayed on small TV fixed on the wall. This created friction when client groups were big. That's why we decided to use a large TV on wheels with a touchscreen:
       <ul>
        <li>It was easily transportable within the showroom from one room to the other.</li>
        <li>The touchscreen was necessary to virtually walk in the virtual space and to interact with products.</li>
      </ul>
    </p><br>
    <h4>Touchscreen interaction flowchart:</h4>

  </div>

<div class="container-project">
 <h2>PROTOTYPING & TESTING</h2>
 <p>We've worked together with the company <a href="https://www.pixelpool.com/" target="_blank" class="link">Pixelpool</a> to make the virtual stores and the samples. <br>We ran a first pilot of the Virtual Showroom Experience with Intersport. <br>This pilot was a success to understand how to improve the overall sell-in experience through the virtual showroom.</p>
 <p>We iteratively talked with the AEs to understand how we could make the experience better:
   <ul>
    <li>For them to present - <i>Functionalities</i></li>
    <li>For the clients to interact with - <i>Content</i></li>
  </ul></p>
  <p>For instance, the navigation on the touchscreen was not the easiest for the AEs and we decided to create a new feature: navigation with an xBox controller. This was a small change in the build of the whole VR file that the developers had to do. But it increased the a lot the interaction and made it very smooth and also very fun to interact with the showroom.</p>

          <h2>LEARNINGS</h2>
          <p>This project was very insightful in different ways. I had the opportunity to be on the field for a year and to understand every aspects of sales meetings with clients. I discovered many frictions. Getting a new role in the DGTM team enabled me to use this knowledge to improve the ordering process. I tested different technologies and the best one so far, in terms of flexibility and cost-effectiveness, was the virtual showroom. It is still a big work in progress as the experience can be even more integrated in the whole buying flow. </p>
