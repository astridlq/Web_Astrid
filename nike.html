      <h2>CONTEXT</h2>

      <p>I’ve worked at Nike as Digital Go to Market (DGTM) Experience Specialist. <br>
        In this DGTM team, we aimed to improve the user experience for our B2B clients (Intersport, Footlocker, SDI…) through the 4 phases of the order process. <br><br>
        We supported Account Executives (AE) to:
        <ul>
          <li><b>Prepare</b>: get the different offerings ready for their clients</li>
          <li><b>Present</b>: sell the offerings with story marketing content</li>
          <li><b>Collaborate</b>: fine tune orders together with the clients</li>
          <li><b>Finalize</b>: place orders through the Nike B2B online shop.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

  <div class="container-project">
    <p>I had the opportunity to work on several project for different phases of the projects. For instance:
      <ul>
        <li><b>Present</b>: Virtual Reality experience for the Football category</li>
        <li><b>Finalize</b>: Digital collection book for Intersport</li>
      </ul><br>
      After 1 year being on the field, dealing with AE and clients, I acquired a 360 understanding of this digital B2B experience. <br>That’s how I moved into another position to manage and develop the Virtual Showroom Experience for several accounts.</p>

        <h2>BACKGROUND RESEARCH</h2>
        <br>
        <h4>Ordering process & showroom setup.</h4>
        <div class="img-left">
          <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dduozp62x/image/upload/c_scale,q_auto/v1603887618/portfolio/Screenshot_2020-10-28_at_13.19.51_w3ehl1.png" width="30%" class="image-project-detail mindmap-image" alt="mindmap">

            <p>Nike EMEA orders a huge number of samples for each new collection to distribute it across all the territories for the sell-in period (which occurs 4 times a year).<br>
              I assisted many times the AEs in the placement of their order. I also took care of setting up the showrooms with the correct samples, which took on average 3-4 days with 5 people working full-time.<br>
              I noticed that AEs were often very busy to prepare for their sales meetings and they had not a lot of time to help to setup the showrooms. This was a real pain point for them, even though it was crucial they helped since they were the ones with the knowledge of the products.<br>
            Besides many duplicates, samples were sometimes not even in their final version: some were missing, other ones are not in the correct colour/material.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h4>Client meetings.</h4>
        <p>I assisted to different types of client meetings (from big accounts to small ones). Clients often followed PowerPoint presentations on a small TV from a distance taking notes on a printed version that was given to them at the beginning of the day. I realised that missing samples or wrong ones were a real struggle for AEs to lead their meeting efficiently.

      <!-- PROBLEM -->

      <div class="problem">
        <h2>PROBLEM</h2>
        <p>We gathered as a team to highlight the different problems after sharing our observations. We came up with some "How might we" questions to help us frame the main issue:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>How can we reduce samples waste (production, shipment, storage, wrong samples)?</li>
          <li>How can we change the showroom setup process to enable AEs to focus on the preparation of their meetings?</li>
          <li>How can we make sure AEs have the correct samples to present during their sales meeting with clients?</li>
          <li>How can we improve the B2B overall showroom experience to make it more interactive and efficient?</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p class="problematic"><i>GOAL: To create a premium digital selling experience <br>in order to land the account offering.</i></p>
      <h2>JOB-TO-BE-DONE</h2>
      <p class="job-to-be-done"><b>As</b> an Account Executive, <b>when</b> preparing for sales meeting, <b>I want to</b> be sure I have the correct materials to work, <b>so I can</b> lead interactive sessions with my clients efficiently.</p>

      <!-- IDEATION -->

      <div class="ideation">
        <h2>IDEATION</h2>
        <p>We investigated on several solutions to answer this. To do that, used different technologies such as holograms, 3D modelling, or iBeacon…</p>

    <div class="container-project">
      <div class="ideation">
      <p>The one that we deciced to move forward with was the <b>Virtual Showroom Experience</b>.
        <br>Some of the reasons were:
        <ul>
          <li><b>Technology</b>: the easiest solution to implement within all the showrooms across Europe.</li>
          <li><b>Costs</b>: the most cost-effective solution we’ve found for the long term in terms of investments and of savings on the sample orders.</li>
          <li><b>Time</b>: a very flexible solution that can be adjusted last minute by the AE.</li>
        </ul>
      </p><br>
      <p>The idea was to create a virtual showroom which would showcase the 3D models of the collections presented during the sell-in sessions. <br>The PowerPoint presentations of the sell-in meetings were displayed on small TV fixed on the wall. This created friction when client groups were big. That's why we decided to use a large TV with touchscreen on wheels:
       <ul>
        <li>It was easily transportable within the showroom from one room to the other.</li>
        <li>The touchscreen was necessary to virtually walk in that virtual space and to interact with products</li>
      </ul>
    </p><br>

<div class="container-project">
 <h2>PROTOTYPING & TESTING</h2>
 <p>We ran a first pilot of the Virtual Showroom with one client account. <br>This pilot was a success to understand how to improve the digital experience through the virtual showroom.</p>
 <p>We iteratively talked with the AEs to understand how we could make the experience better:
   <ul>
    <li>For them to present - Functionalities</li>
    <li>For the clients to interact with - Content</li>
  </ul></p>
