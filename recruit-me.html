      <p>Employee Retention rates at many companies is low (and dropping). According to a study led by Deloitte in 2018, it's less than 2 years at many big tech companies and the cost of losing one employee can range from tens of thousands of dollars, to 1.5-2 times their annual salary.
        <br>So how come that big companies - which have so many job opportunities - fail at retaining talents in house?
