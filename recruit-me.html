  <div class="problem">
    <h2>PROBLEM</h2>
    <p>Employee Retention rates at many companies is low (and dropping). According to a study led by Deloitte in 2018, it's less than 2 years at many big tech companies and the cost of losing one employee can range from tens of thousands of dollars, to 1.5-2 times their annual salary.
      <br>So how come that big companies - which have so many job opportunities - fail at retaining talents in house?
      <br>
      <br>
      After some research done among Nike employees working at the European Headquarters, we discovered that the internal job portal was so outdated that most people would prefer to use LinkedIn to look for new opportunities. Another insight we got from several millennials was that they were not even looking at this job portal because there are better chances to get a job by networking and become one day a "preferred candidate"...
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>SOLUTION</h2>
  <p>To cope with this issue of equality and transparency within corporate companies, we imagined a platform helping managers to find talents easily within the organisation and empowering employees to discover new job opportunities. And all this based on skills...</p>

  <div class="my-role">
    <h2>MY ROLE</h2>
    <p>This was my final project for the coding bootcamp I followed in Amsterdam - @ Le Wagon.
      Together with 3 teammates, we worked to put everything we have learnt - and more - into practice over a two-week period: inventing, pitching, designing, coding and deploying an original idea.
      <br><br>
      The 2 first days were dedicated to the user stories, coming up with the database schema, the mock-ups to fine tune the unique value proposition of the app and finally the routes of the website. After that we started the coding part. We divided the tasks so that everyone would focus on the area they preferred. I designed the whole UI and I mainly focused on the front-end part to make sure the whole website would have a consistent result.</p>
